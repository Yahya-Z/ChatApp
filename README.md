- **Composer** (dependency manager for PHP)
- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **npm** (Node package manager, comes with Node.js)
- **MySQL** (or another compatible database)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yahya-Z/ChatApp
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```

3. **Install PHP dependencies**:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

4. **Install JavaScript dependencies**:
   Use npm to install the necessary JavaScript packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Set up your environment variables**:
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to create your own `.env` file:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Open the `.env` file in a text editor and configure the following settings:
     - **APP_URL**: Set this to your local development URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).
     - **DB_DATABASE**: Set this to the name of your database (e.g., `chatapp`).
     - **DB_USERNAME**: Your database username (default is usually `root`).
     - **DB_PASSWORD**: Your database password (leave it blank if you have no password).

6. **Generate the application key**:
   Run the following command to generate a unique application key:
   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

7. **Run database migrations**:
   This command will create the necessary tables in your database:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

8. **Start the development server**:
   Launch the Laravel development server with:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```
   And in a new terminal window run:
   ```bash
   php run dev
   ```

   By default, this will run the server at `http://localhost:8000`.

9. **Run the frontend build**:
   In a new terminal window, navigate to the project directory again and run:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will compile your Vue.js assets and enable hot reloading.

10. **Run this command**:
   In a new terminal window, run:
   ```bash
   php artisan queu:work
   ```
   Now your ready to jumb in!
